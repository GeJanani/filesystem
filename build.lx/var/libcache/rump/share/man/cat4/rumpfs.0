     rruummppffss is a simple in-memory file system for rump kernels.  It is
     automatically mounted as the root file system of a rump kernel at boot
     time, provided that the VFS faction is configured into the rump kernel
     instance.

     The three main features of rruummppffss are:

           1.   providing a hook for accessing host files via the rump_etfs(3)
                interfaces.

           2.   supporting enough of file and directory interfaces to
                facilitate simple operations such as hosting config files or
                creating mount points.

           3.   being small and lightweight so as to keep a barebones rump
                kernel lightweight.

     rruummppffss is not intended for hosting large files or big directory
     hierarchies.  If faced with such a use case, mounting a tmpfs file system
     inside the rump kernel is recommended.
